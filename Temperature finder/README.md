#Temperature_Finder

This is a Temperature Finder project developed in Python with PyQt5 GUI,SQLITE3 Database and API (openweathermap.org)

This program will find Temperature, Pressure and Humidity of the city name you enter.

Execute Main.py file to run Program.

This will not run as I don't wanna reveal my API key , So if you wanna run this program, Just signup to "openweathermap.org" and create your own API Key(its free of cost) and add your API Key in Line number-12 of Main.py file (I had also mentioned in that file).
